# General Info

This is an exploration of the effectiveness of TypeNet proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00126.pdf) at predicting the eligibility and amount of compensation from the insurance company based on pictures of damaged cars.
A much simpler version of TypeNet is implemented to fit the requirements of a [machine learning challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-vehicle-insurance-claim/machine-learning/predict-the-condition-and-insurance-amount-21-fb647347/) and should not be used for other purposes.
